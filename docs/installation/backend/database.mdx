  ![create database name](./database/database1.3.png)

- At step 2 you will be prompted to indicate MySQL User and choose a password for it, reciprocally to the process described before:

  ![create database user](./database/database1.4.png)

- After the username and password are indicated, simply click on the Create User button:

  ![create user](./database/database1.6.png)

- The next windows will allow you to set privileges for the newly created MySQL User similarly to the process described previously.

  Accordingly, you will need to choose the All Privileges option and click on the Next Step button after that:

  ![add user to database](./database/database1.7.png)

- Once done, you will get a confirmation that the MySQL User was successfully added to the MySQL Database:

  ![done](./database/database1.8.png)

That's it.
